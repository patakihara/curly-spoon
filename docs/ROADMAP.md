### Why Android sits at 7 rather than last

Audiobooks are mostly listened to on a phone, while walking or driving, and the things that
make that work — reliable background playback, offline downloads, lock-screen controls,
Android Auto — are exactly what a browser does poorly. Shipping priority 1 to the web only
would be shipping it to the wrong device.

It is not first because it depends on the **API contract** having stopped moving, which
happens once phases 5 and 6 complete priority 1 (the Audiobookshelf client _and_ the
request flow, which the user named as one priority). Building Android against a churning
API means building it twice.

The web app remains a genuine phone experience in the meantime: installable as a PWA, with
Media Session lock-screen controls. It is a good stopgap, not a replacement.

### Why 5a exists

Android was written **blind** — not compiled or run once — so the pipeline that builds it is
itself the risk. 5a therefore lands a minimal Compose app that does nothing but build, plus
the workflow that produces a sideloadable debug APK, well before there is real code
depending on it. It runs in parallel with phase 5 because `apps/android/` and `apps/web/`
are disjoint.

**Why it was written blind is worth correcting, because the inherited reason was wrong.**
Earlier drafts of this file said `dl.google.com` was unreachable and Google's Maven
repository blocked. That was true of the ephemeral **cloud container** phases 1–4 were built
in; it was never checked against the machine development actually moved to. Measured there
on 2026-08-02: `dl.google.com`, `maven.google.com` and `services.gradle.org` all resolve and
respond, and the real AGP 8.7.3 POM downloads fine.

The actual blocker is duller and fixable: that machine has **no JDK, no Android SDK and no
Gradle installed**. So local Android builds are an install away, not a network wall — and
until someone does that install, CI remains the first place `apps/android` is compiled.
Do not propagate the network claim any further; check it before repeating it.

## Target surfaces

Auralis is **one Docker container** serving **one web app** that is a first-class
experience on phone, tablet and desktop, plus a **native Android app** against the same API.

| Surface            | How it ships                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop browser    | The primary large-screen layout: expanded navigation rail, multi-column grids, persistent Now Playing side panel, full keyboard control. Not a stretched phone UI.                 |
| Desktop app window | The web app is an installable PWA, so it runs in its own window with no browser chrome, offline shell and OS media keys. No Electron — nothing to bundle, nothing extra to update. |
| Phone / tablet     | Bottom navigation, full-screen Now Playing sheet, touch gestures.                                                                                                                  |
| Android            | Native Compose + Media3 for background playback and offline downloads.                                                                                                             |

The container is self-contained: the Fastify BFF serves the built web app as static assets
on the same origin, so there is no separate web server, no CORS configuration, and one port
to expose. A working `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` are an **exit criterion of Phase 4** —
from that point on, every phase leaves `docker compose up` working, rather than saving
packaging for the end.

## Phase detail

### 1 — Foundations

pnpm workspaces, strict TypeScript, ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest workspace,
Playwright, GitHub Actions CI running lint + typecheck + unit + e2e.

### 2 — Design system

Token generator (colour from artwork, type, shape, spring motion), theme provider,
component set: button, icon button, card, list item, nav bar/rail, top app bar, search bar,
chip, slider, sheet, dialog, snackbar, progress. Playwright UI tests per component in both
themes.

### 3 — Server BFF

Fastify + zod, encrypted settings store (SQLite), session auth, Audiobookshelf client
covering libraries, items, personalized shelves, search, playback sessions, progress sync,
covers and range-proxied audio.

### 4 — Web shell + container

Routing, adaptive navigation (bottom bar → rail → expanded rail as the window grows),
onboarding (point at your server, sign in), installable PWA with an offline shell, error
boundaries.

Ships the deployment story at the same time, because a self-hosted app that cannot be
self-hosted yet is not a deliverable:

- multi-stage `Dockerfile` — build the web app, prune to production deps, run as a
  non-root user on a distroless-ish base;
- the BFF serving the built assets on its own origin with SPA fallback and immutable
  cache headers for hashed bundles;
- `compose.yaml` with a healthcheck and a single mounted data volume;
- a smoke test that builds the image, boots it against the fake upstreams and asserts the
  app loads and authenticates — so the container is covered by CI, not by hope.

### 5 — Audiobooks

Home shelves ("Continue listening", "Recently added", series), library browse with filter
and sort, item detail, and the full player: chapter list, variable speed, sleep timer,
bookmarks, ±30s, progress sync, Media Session integration, mini player.

### 5a — Android build skeleton

A minimal Compose application that compiles and nothing more: Gradle version catalog,
module structure, Material 3 theme wired to dynamic colour, and a single screen. Plus
`.github/workflows/android.yml`, which assembles a debug APK and uploads it as an artifact
on every push.

It also scaffolds the **Android Auto manifest plumbing** — `automotive_app_desc.xml`, the
`com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data, and an empty `MediaLibraryService` — so
that CI proves the Auto declarations compile and merge correctly before phase 7 depends on
them. Manifest-merger failures are a miserable thing to debug blind.

The deliverable is not a feature — it is proof that a machine which cannot reach the Android
SDK can still produce an installable APK. Getting that wrong later, with a real app on top
of it, is far more expensive.

**Closed on 2026-08-03, on the evidence rather than on the code being written.** The first
`Android` workflow run against `07ce0c3` went green and uploaded a 12 MB
`auralis-debug-apk` artifact. That is what the phase was for: blind-written Compose sources
compile, the Android Auto manifest plumbing merges without a manifest-merger failure, and
`gradle/actions/wrapper-validation` accepts the committed wrapper jar. There is now a known
-good pipeline for phase 7 to build on.

Still true, and worth keeping: **no JDK, Android SDK or Gradle is installed on the
development machine**, so CI remains the only place `apps/android` compiles. Installing a
JDK would demote it to a second opinion and make the edit-build loop local.

### 6 — Book requests

Pluggable indexers (AudiobookBay scraper, Prowlarr), pluggable download clients
(qBittorrent, Transmission), request queue with approval and status tracking, post-import
Audiobookshelf scan trigger. Completes priority 1 on the web, and freezes the API surface
that phase 7 builds against.

### 7 — Android: audiobooks + requests

The priority-1 experience, natively:

- Jetpack Compose with Material 3 Expressive and dynamic colour from wallpaper and artwork.
- **Media3 `ExoPlayer` behind a `MediaLibraryService`** — see "Android Auto is a design
  constraint" below; this is not the same choice as a plain `MediaSessionService`.
- Offline downloads with resumable transfers, so a commute without signal still works.
- Progress synced through the same BFF, so a book continued on the phone resumes correctly
  in the browser and vice versa.
- The request flow from phase 6, so a book can be asked for from the phone.

Podcast and music screens follow in phases 8 and 9 as their APIs land.

#### Android Auto is a design constraint, not a feature toggle

Auto does not render the app's UI. It renders **its own templated UI** from a browse tree
the app publishes, so the playback layer has to be built as a
`MediaLibraryService` (`MediaSessionService` + a browsable hierarchy) from the first commit.
Bolting a browse tree onto a session-only player later means restructuring playback, which
is precisely the sort of rework this roadmap is ordered to avoid.

What that implies concretely:

- **A shallow, driving-safe browse tree.** Auto caps how many items it will show and how
  deep a user may navigate while moving. The root is therefore intent-shaped, not
  library-shaped: _Continue_, _Downloaded_, _Books_, _Series_, _Podcasts_, _Music_ — with
  "Continue" first, because in a car it is almost always the right answer.
- **Chapters are the skip target.** In the car, "next" must mean _next chapter_, not next
  file or next book. Audiobook chapter boundaries drive `seekToNext`/`seekToPrevious`, and
  the media metadata advertises chapter titles so the head unit displays something useful.
- **Voice.** `onPlayFromSearch` / `onSearch` wired so "play <title>" and "resume my book"
  work without touching the screen — the only genuinely safe interaction while driving.
- **Playback resumption.** Auto asks for a recent-items root after a reboot so playback can
  resume from the head unit before the phone is unlocked.
- **Offline matters more here.** Signal is worst exactly where cars go, so downloads are a
  prerequisite for Auto being usable, not an optional extra.
- **Manifest plumbing:** `automotive_app_desc.xml` plus the
  `com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data, and an intent filter for
  `MediaBrowserService` compatibility. Scaffolded in 5a so CI validates it early.

**Two honest caveats.** First, Android Auto cannot be tested here or on CI — verification
needs the Desktop Head Unit on a real machine, or an actual car. It will be on the user to
confirm, and phase 7 will ship a written test script for doing so. Second, because Auralis
is sideloaded rather than Play Store distributed, it will not appear in Auto until
**"Unknown sources" is enabled in Android Auto's developer settings** on the phone; that
step will be documented, since without it the app simply never shows up and looks broken.

### 8 — Podcasts

Podcast library browse, feed search and subscribe, episode lists with download state,
new-episode shelf, podcast player affordances — on web and Android together, now that both
shells exist.

### 9 — Music

Jellyfin browse (albums, artists, genres, playlists), Spotify-depth search including
**lyrics search**, gapless queue playback, synced lyrics view, music request provider —
web and Android together.

### 10 — Release polish

Performance budgets enforced in CI (bundle size, Lighthouse on the desktop and mobile
layouts), a full accessibility audit, multi-arch image publishing (amd64 + arm64, so it
runs on a Pi or a NAS as happily as on a desktop), and release automation.

### 11 — Alternative app-store distribution (F-Droid / Droid-ify)

Sideloading an APK from a CI artifact is fine for the person who builds it and hostile to
everyone else — no update notifications, no signature continuity, no discovery. The goal of
this phase is that Auralis is installable and **updatable** from a normal F-Droid client
(Droid-ify, Neo Store, F-Droid itself), which all speak the same repository format.

**Start this phase by delegating an investigation**, not an implementation. The requirements
are exacting, they change, and getting them wrong is expensive in a way that is hard to
reverse — a signing key, in particular, is a one-way door. The agent's first deliverable is
a written findings document naming which distribution route to take and what the repo must
change to satisfy it; only then does anything get built.

What that investigation must settle:

- **Which route.** Roughly three, in ascending order of effort and reach: publish our own
  F-Droid repository (fully under our control, users add a URL — `fdroidserver` or one of
  the GitHub-Actions repo generators); submit to **IzzyOnDroid**, which indexes APKs from
  GitHub releases and is already enabled in most Droid-ify installs; or submit to the
  **official F-Droid** repo, the widest reach and the strictest bar, since they build from
  source on their own infrastructure. These are not exclusive.
- **Whether we can meet the FOSS bar.** F-Droid proper refuses proprietary dependencies.
  Audit what `apps/android` actually pulls in — note that the Android Auto plumbing is only
  a `com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data _string_ and an XML descriptor, not a
  Play Services dependency, so it is very likely fine; confirm rather than assume. Anything
  that genuinely needs a proprietary library has to become a build flavour.
- **Reproducible builds**, which the official repo wants and which our current
  `assembleDebug` pipeline does not attempt. This is the item most likely to force real
  changes to the Gradle config.
- **Signing.** A release keystore, kept out of git, in CI as a secret. Decide the key and
  the `applicationId` **once** — F-Droid identifies an app by package name plus signature,
  and changing either later means users cannot update, they must uninstall and reinstall,
  losing their data. Treat this as irreversible.
- **`versionCode` discipline and release automation** — a monotonic code derived from tags,
  signed release APKs attached to GitHub releases, and a changelog in the layout F-Droid
  metadata expects (`metadata/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt`), plus store listing text,
  screenshots and an icon.

**Do not start this before phase 7 ships a real Android app.** Everything here is packaging
around a working artifact, and the irreversible decisions above should be made once the app
they identify actually exists.
